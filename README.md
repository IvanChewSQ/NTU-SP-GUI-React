# NTU-SP GUI Project (REACT)
React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. <br>
This repo guides you on the setting up of the environment.


## Getting Started with Create React App
### To-do
- Set up compatible environment files.
- Set up minimum environment files.
- Running of program.


## Set Up
```sh
   # Clone GitHub repo to terminal
   git clone https://github.com/IvanChewSQ/NTU-SP-GUI-React.git
   cd react_gui

   # Install python libraries
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Updating of program requirements (only perform when there are new updates to the program):
```sh
   # Clone GitHub repo
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```


## Start Up
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


## Clean up
- gitignore files add using this [https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore](https://github.com/IvanChewSQ/NTU-SP-GUI-React/blob/main/.gitignore)







## OTHERS (for References)

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
